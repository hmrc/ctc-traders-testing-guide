# Apply for production credentials 

Learn how to apply for production credentials for CTC Traders API v3.0.

For information about key NCTS dates, see [NCTS technical interface specification](/guides/ctc-traders-tis/#ncts-key-dates).

**Note:** If you also want to use [CTC Guarantee Balance API v3.0](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-guarantee-balance/3.0) after the UK NCTS5 service goes live, you do NOT have to apply for separate production credentials for that API.

## Production access testing phases

Production access testing in the NCTS5 Trader Test environment is split into 2 phases, so you will have 2 opportunities to apply for CTC Traders API v2.0 production credentials.

**Note:** Ordinarily, you will need to apply only once for production credentials for the API. This can be for either phase but we recommend that you complete production access testing during both phases. However, there are scenarios when you might have to submit 1 or more additional applications for production credentials. For information about these scenarios, see [Additional production credentials applications](#additional-production-credentials-applications).

The production access testing phases are as follows.

| Phase | Scope | Start date | End date |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- | -------- |
| 1 | NCTS5 transition rules only | 30 October 2023 | 03 June 2024 |
| 2 | NCTS5 final rules only | Summer 2024 | (No end date) |

During summer 2024, the NCTS5 Trader Test environment will move back into NCTS5 final mode after the UK NCTS5 service goes live. We will tell you the exact date of the switchover nearer the time.

**Important:** If you have not gained production credentials before 01 July 2024 but you gain production credentials after that, your credentials will be based only on NCTS final rules and you will be unable to use the live API system until NCTS5 final rules are implemented. Therefore, depending on your operational needs, it might be in your interest to complete production access testing during phase 1 and apply for production credentials during that phase.

## Production credentials applications during phase 1

If you apply for production credentials during phase 1 and your application is successful:

- your credentials will be based on NCTS5 transition rules, but they will remain valid after the UK NCTS5 service goes live and NCTS5 Trader Test moves back to NCTS5 final mode
- you will not be required to complete further production access testing during phase 2, but we recommend that you carry out production access testing for NCTS final rules and submit your test results

You will need to submit your production credentials application form and production access test results at least 14 days before the UK NCTS5 service goes live if you want to have production credentials for the API before the go-live. You can still apply for credentials closer to the go-live date but you would not be guaranteed to receive your credentials in time for the go-live date or the first few days thereafter.

## Production credentials applications during phase 2

During phase 2, you will complete your NCTS5 final rules testing in NCTS5 Trader Test as part of your assurance testing.

If you do not gain production credentials for the API during phase 1, you will also have to complete your NCTS5 final rules testing in NCTS5 Trader Test as part of your production access testing and then apply for production credentials during phase 2.

If your application is successful:

- your credentials will be based only on NCTS5 final rules
- you will be unable to use the live API system until NCTS5 final rules are implemented

Therefore, the only way to get access to the live API system as soon as possible after the UK NCTS5 service goes live  is to carry out production access testing during phase 1 and make a successful application for production credentials during phase 1.

## Submitting a production credentials application

When you are confident that your software is fully compatible with NCTS5 and you want to apply for production credentials for the API:

- log all your evidence and test results by filling in all sections of the [CTC Traders API Application for Production Credentials Checklist](downloads/CTC_Traders_API_v2.0_Application_For_Production_Checklist_v1.1_January_2024(004).docx) form (Microsoft Word document):
  - appendix A in the form lists the test scenarios that you need to run for production access testing
  - you need to test only the process flows supported by your application software
  - if your software supports both normal and simplified procedure process flows, you can choose between 2 different combinations (A or B) of tests (you do not need to test both combinations)
  - if your software does not support pre-lodged departures, you do NOT have to run any tests for pre-lodged departures before you apply for production credentials
  - you must answer all of the questions in the form
- when ready, email your completed form to [SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk)
- we will check your test evidence using the information you provided in the form
- when we are satisfied that you have completed a sufficient level of testing, you will be granted access to the live API system but this access can be used only after the UK NCTS5 service goes live

**Important:** Any test results submitted with production credentials applications must be less than 14 days old.

## Additional production credentials applications 

if you make a successful application for production credentials for the API:

- the credentials will ordinarily cover all versions of your application software for this version of the API
- you should NOT have to rerun production access testing and submit another application for production credentials

However, there are 3 possible scenarios where you might be asked to make 1 or more additional applications for production credentials.

| Scenario                                                     | Description                                                  | Actions required                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Adding support for inbound or outbound process flows after receiving production credentials<br /><br/>**Note:** Outbound refers to standard and pre-lodged departures. | Your software supports only inbound process flows (or outbound process flows) when you submit your production credentials application but you later add support for outbound process flows (or inbound process flows). | You will need to run the mandatory production access tests (see decision matrix in appendix A of the checklist form) for the outbound process flows or inbound process flows and submit another application for production credentials. |
| Different software versions with some supporting inbound flows and others supporting outbound process flows | You build different variants or versions of your software for different traders and some versions support only inbound process flows while other versions support only outbound process flows. | You will need to run the mandatory production access tests for the relevant process flows in each version of your software and submit an application for production credentials for each version of your software. |
| Significant changes to NCTS5 documentation<br /><br/>**Note:** This scenario is beyond our control and it is unlikely to happen. | CTC Authorities change the order of message types in process flows,  or make a significant change to NCTS5 documentation other than changes to existing rules and/or conditions. | You would have to modify your software if it supports the affected process flow(s) and rerun any applicable production access tests and submit another application for production credentials. |
